## Description
### For this project we had to create a 2D game inspired of the famous game "Ant Hill".
The only order was to respect the MVC.

This game was created during our 4th year at the engineering school ESME Surdia between February and May 2018.

We have done your best to respect the deadline although our game can always been updated. 

In this project you will find an MVC architecture and also some class's which belong to Qt and have an inherit process.

## Result
