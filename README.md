### Description
#### For this project we had to create a 2D game inspired of the famous game "Ant Hill".
The only order was to respect the MVC.

This game was created during our 4th year at the engineering school ESME Surdia between February and May 2018.

We have done your best to respect the deadline although our game can always been updated. 

In this project you will find an MVC architecture and also some class's which belong to Qt and have an inherit process.

### Gameplay

Play with our game is very simple, first of all, you need to start the game. Then you will see one harvester doing his job which consist to collect ressources. Your goal will be to resist as long as possible to the enemy assaults. To reach this goal you will be allowed to create soldiers in order to protect your anthill and also harvester to collect more ressources. To create them you just need to click on the buttons in the bottom right of the screen.
Well, you are ready to play, good luck.
