## Description
### For this project we had to create a 2D game inspired of the famous game "Ant Hill".
The only rule was to respect the MVC.

This game was created during our 4th year at the engineering school ESME Surdia between February and May 2018.

The project is finished although we can always add updates.

In this projetc you will find an MVC architecture and also some class's which belongs to Qt and have an inherit process between them.

## Result
